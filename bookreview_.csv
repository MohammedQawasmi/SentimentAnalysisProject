PingJockey,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
This book has controversy, but most of it stems from reviewers that believe all people are good inside and unicorns deliver their vegan low fat cappuccino with cream. Well, most people aren't kind, and this book prepared me for reality. It doesn't teach one to be self absorbed or evil or a heretic. It teaches one to stand your ground and to protect yourself from taking unnecessary burden, unfair treatment, and manipulation from corrupt people.

J.S. Bach,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
there seems to be a lot of love and hate surrounding this book, so if you are curious but unsure, this review should help you decide whether or not to buy the book, and how it will impact youFirst, to understand the 48 laws of power, you must know two key ideas1. you CAN NOT escape the power game. thinking you can ""not participate"" is as foolish as thinking that you could somehow escape gravity or make the sun stand still.  Robert Greene explains why in the intro with some excellent examples2. the 48 laws of power are neither good nor evil; they are just LAWS.  If someone pushed a man off a cliff would you blame gravity for for his demise? This is the mindset you must adopt in order to  learn a lot from this book.Things I Liked- NEW PARADIGMafter reading the 48 laws, you will never see the world the same way again. once you understand some of these laws you will see many underlying currents and motives you did not see before.- INCREASES POWERone of the main reasons to buy the book. you wil become exponentially more powerfull by knowing and understanding these laws-CRYSTAL CLEARevery law is clearly outlined with ""transgression"" of the law, ""observance"" of the law, keys to power, and a ""reversal""-GREAT STORIESthe 48 laws are packed with mindblowing and sometimes humorous stories of people in history practicing these laws. this is helpful as some of the concepts are quite abstract.What I didn't like-RISKYan old proverb says "" A man who plays with snakes will eventually be bitten"". If you begin to use the 48 Laws improperly, you could get yourself in some dangerous situations, lose friends, piss off a lot a people, and destroy relationships- REQUIRES DISCERNMENTif you you are looking for a highly concrete book that the says ""do xyz and you will accomplish vyx"" look elsewhere. the Laws require good judgement and and and prospecting nature to practice and apply-NOT FOR EVERYONE If you are aghast at the idea of manipulation and deceit then read with caution.OVERALL: If you want to have more power or a better understanding of why different situations turn out the the way they do, you should definitely read the 48 laws of power by Robert Greene. If you want to be naive, easily manipulated, weak, you should ignore this book and go watch some netfilx.Thanks for reading

All ethics, decency, courtesy and fairness falls out of the Golden Rule - ""Treat others as you would like to be treated"". So the question is what happens when we are all those things, for the best of our ability, but we get treated poorly by a narcissist that abuses our kindness. Do we the embrace the psychology of our abuser and accept that is how the world is and that it was OUR fault for being naive?These rules are the revenge fantasy of a wounded child archetype. They are highly dysfunctional in any healthy community, relationship, friendships of family. If you practice them, you will end up losing the most valuable of friendships and other relationships that would have helped you out the most in life, and keep you in that hell.If you want to be able to recognize psychopathic indicators in others, read up some books on modern psychology that addresses that directly. It is not very hard to recognize such people.I heard this is the most popular book ordered in US prisons. That should tell you something.

Not everything in here is pretty, good, or pleasant. Then again, this is about power, not about being a ""good person"", whatever that means.I wish I had read this when I was in my teens. It would have prevented me making a lot of naive mistakes as a young man.

Ludovician,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
This book takes the worst parts of the human mind and drags them down into the abyss. And then thrives there. When you open this book, it's akin to stepping at the edge of the cavern. You don't notice how its stalactite-filled ceiling echo the horrors and the gore and the piss and the vomit of others that came before. Its passages are full of the bodies of good men and women who were caught by the beasts that live there. You know you should turn back after seeing the first mangled corpse, but you're enthralled by the journey. It may come off as exciting. ""What harm can it do?"" you might think. ""There's treasure at the end,"" you might think.Then you see the first demon of forty-eight. It doesn't do anything. It stands, however, at the centre of the first level. It stares at you, its black eyes full of emptyness. You may grow scared. And you'd be right to. Or, like a fool, you will approach this horned burnt skin creature. It stands tall and appears almost as if it were a part of the cavern itself. Its transparent nature, made to lure you into thinking it does not exist, makes it even more dangerous. And when you are well within its reach, it seizes you with its mighty clawed hand and eats you whole. But something strange happens. You don't die. You fall. And you fall far.When you finally come to, your body, full of pain, and soreness, and that horrible feeling of nausea explodes inside you. As if a piece of your soul was eaten away. It takes you a while before you realise that you are now deeper into the abyss. There's less light. But you still hear some of the comforts of nature. The rushing water into the bodies of aqua. The sound of drops from the stalactites. The distant birds chirping. You would think that what you saw was some illusion. That you slipped and fell. Or that some other thing occurred. A bad lunch; a meal that made you ill.  If you were smart, you'd turn around and go home. But most people aren't smart. They keep going.You hear a fox's cry suddenly. You can't believe your ears. A fox? Here? And you follow the sound. When you arrive to where the fox sits, its back to you. You might say, ""Oh you poor creature. Are you lost? Do you need any help getting out?"" Then it turns. It's not a fox. It's not....an animal in the normal sense. The world around you suddenly grows colder and darker. You may take a step back. But the fox, with red eyes, eyes that are bleeding and putrid and full of maggots, follows you. It's screeching. Loudly. And you cover your ears. But that doesn't help. And when the fox reaches up to you, it lunges at you. And eats its way into your heart. And you black out. When you awaken, the cavern is different. As if you were moved elsewhere. The walls are growing a faint red. Your chest feels like it's on fire. And you can't feel your arm. But it slowly begins to regain its feeling. Then you puke out blackness. It's not a puke like anything you've seen. The human body isn't made to expel something like this. Something is clearly wrong. That was the second demon. You might panic and run. Or you might not. If you were smart, you'd turn around and go home. But most people aren't smart. They keep going.You rub your head, then your arm. You get up to your feet and look around. Things seem hazy. Much darker than before. You're confused. You don't know what you saw. You look around. Maybe try and find a way out. Suddenly you see a light at the end. You decide to follow it. And you spot an old man sitting on a small mound. He had a long flowing white beard, a grand white gown with the names of holy people written and he wore a crown. Much rather, he wore seven crowns made of gold, silver and copper,  and each crown was full of diamonds of various colours and shapes. His eyes were gentle. And smiled, like a father does to his child. His presence gave off something warm about it.""Who are you?"" You might ask.""I am the last of all that is good. Turn ye back and never return. Ere thou too shalt be consumed,"" the mysterious fellow said, in a loud and booming voice. You might think the old man mad, others might think the old man illogical, and finally others might say that he's ignorant or outdated or that he can't understand the intricacies of the new world, the modern world. He is a relic of the past, with all those pesky morals and traditions. We can't have morals or traditions in the future.If you heed the advice, you may yet be saved. If you don't, then your soul will slowly be consumed. Until you too are no different than the demons you should rightfully fear. Even if you were not a religious person, it would be obvious to see how unethical this book is. You will become a spawn of evil. And no amount of prayer and church-going will ever be enough. Because you have been done the unforgiveable knowingly.If you wish to learn how to use power for good, then I would recommend Aquinas's De Regno, Vincent of Beauvais's The Education of Noble Children, Cicero's De Officiis, Seneca's De Clementia, and the King's Mirror by anonymous. There are many more on the observation of power and its use in business, but these work. And you don't need to be underhanded in order to do so. The best businessman is the one who can keep his soul intact, and thinks of the good of others. Not himself.

EJ Lohbeck,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
This is a controversial book, mostly because the average person wishes the world were peaceful, friendly, and not full of chaos and drama...Well, unfortunately, wishes don't make it a reality, and there are people out there who prey on the weak and take advantage of those who are too trusting.  The 48 Laws of Power (by Robert Greene) illuminates many ways that those predatory people can gain power over anyone who is not aware of the manipulation and power games they play.  And while it may take some practice, study, and a keen eye for detail, anyone can learn to spot these (often subtle) power struggles and often even turn the tables on the enemy at hand!Please, if you are considering reading this book but are 'on the fence' about it because of the people saying negative things about it, just read it!  This has become one of my favorite books in a short period of time, and it has given me a new way to perceive the world around me.  Robert Greene is a great author, and the way this book is formatted / written makes it educational, entertaining, and compelling, all at the same time.  I wouldn't necessarily recommend it to every single person in the world, because it is not for the faint of heart; but if you've ever been taken advantage of, shut out of someone's life, lost control of a situation, had someone feign authority over you (successfully), had relationship problems, problems in the workplace, etc, you deserve to give this a read-through at LEAST once.  Don't take everything at face-value... and by that I mean don't decapitate anyone for ""transgression"" of any of the laws, but definitely think about times you have seen these laws at work, and how a grasp on a relevant law from the book could have changed the outcome of that particular scenario..Long story short, this is an amazing book!  I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!  :)

48 laws of power are 48 ways to manipulate  people to your will by any and all means necessary. ""Create a cult like following"" give your disciples rituals to perform and ask them to make sacrifices in your behalf"".""When asking for help, appeal to peoples self interest, never their mercy or gratitude"".Strike the Shepard and the sheep will scatter. Play dumb, lure people in with kindness and use it against then later.This book will not inspire anything good.

WOW!  I was asked to purchase this book for a client.  Which I did.  I wanted to see what my client was reading, so I ordered the for myself. I read the back cover....I was scared for humanity.  Basically it is a ""how to"" manipulate and not take any responsibility for your own actions.  ""Don't outshine the master.""  WHO is the master?  Talks about victims....so that make YOU reading the book, the tormentor?""Pose as a friend, work as a spy."" I get that we should take control and not let people take advantage of us.

Ramblin' Man,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
This book is a must for anyone working for the corporate leviathans of our age.  The scholarly  research for this book is immense and impressive.  It contains more non-fiction anecdotes from over thousands of years of human history than any book I have ever read.I graduated college in engineering in1996 right as the treasonous two decade plus mass movement of plants and entire industries began in earnest  to China and Mexico.  As millions of American jobs have been lost, dwindling work forces have been fighting like junkyard dogs over scarce resources.I was naive and tended to believe the best in people as I was born and raised in a small and relatively isolated enclave in Southern Appalachia.  The last 24 years of Hard Knocks has made me a different person.  I have been betrayed, knifed in the back, shut out by cliques, blind-sided publicity, etc.  Nobody is after me in particular but absolutely EVERYONE is looking out after number one and don’t care who goes down in the process.  Humanity has not changed over the millennia!I have unwittingly learned some of this book’s techniques over the years and have been a survivor of many mass layoffs that were inflicted on the workforce (during times of record profits I might add in case you might want to argue the business  necessity of the firings).  I am not using this book as a climb to the top as the upper echelons are much less secure and overrated than many tend to believe.  Being a manager in a giant global conglomerate is like being the head football coach of a team where you control nearly nothing yet have all the responsibility for success or failure.This book teaches survival.  I reject that these principles are amoral.  They are true reality.  The folks who are pretend religious with Jesus coffee mugs and Bibles on their desks will put a thousand working families on the street if that’s what it takes to get their own personal bonus for the year.  That’s just the way it is.Take what you need from this book and sweep the rest under the table.  Use the principles according to your needs, organizational structure, market conditions, and personal strengths.  I wish I had this book when I graduated college but would not have paid attention to it.  I was full of optimism and Pollyanna positive thinking.  The harsh reality of how the world works has set in and this book is a nightly reader for me as a result.

Ritu K.,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
The two stars I am giving this book is because it DID teach me how power hungry people behave and what manipulation tactics they use. So, this book is invaluable in that it clearly lays down for people who have been on the receiving end of bullies, narcissistic people and manipulators, exactly what tactics they are using. So, while this will disturb you to the core, please read it if you been taken advantage of people like these in the past. For Self Defense and Awareness Purposes solely. Now that I have said that, this is a highly disturbing read. Yes, many power hungry people do behave this way. Yes, this is the REALITY of how people and institutions around the world manipulate and push people with less people around. But the author seems to be condoning them. I was deeply disturbed by this book and the author's ""voice."" If they meant this as an impartial study of reality (sad and depressing as that is), that is NOT how this comes across at all. In fact, I think a lot of the people who will be attracted to this book will be power hungry, narcissistic or outright narcissists. And this book is a manual that will help them hurt other people. And the rest who stumble across this book will probably be disgusted by it and shrink back. But to those, I say: Read this book as self defense. I am not sure what exactly the author intended by writing this book but we can use it to defend ourselves against predators. The next time you come across someone at work or at home whose power moves you just don't understand, look at this book. They are probably using one of these tactics that normal, decent people (which I think most, or at least, many people are) just don't use. This is truly a manual for how to become a narcissist.

Billy,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
If I say this book saved my life it would seem like an exageration, but that's exactly how I feel about it.  Contrary to what some reviewers might write, in my opinion and experience this book doesn't turn you into a monster, but rather informs you well enough to see the monsters around you, how they operate in all manner of obvious or subtle ways to take advantage of you, and how you can avoid or deal with them.  Basically, it doesn't tell you to create pot-holes for others to stumble upon or fall into, but opens your eyes to see the pot-holes and how to navigate your affairs safely around them.  My business partner is a modern-day Shylock -- a manipulating, lying, greedy opportunist -- who doesn't hesitate to grab all she could under the disguise of a very sweet, caring friend who constantly says ""oh, you're like family to me;"" but underneath it all she's just hoping you'd make that one irretractable mistake of signing away your whole life to her.  If you're peace-loving and easy-going, a lot of people hardly ever fail to mistake your meekness for weakness, and even ride you like a donkey to their glory if they can.  I don't know about you, but it really hurts tearfully when you suddenly wake up to the realization that you've been taken for the fool of the century all along.  Thanks to this book for helping me see what's been going on.  And a very special thanks to my friend, Marie Guillaumes, the Editor of Illuminatista: Mind Alchemy by Juliette and Julie Williams, who listened patiently to my predicament and recommended this book to me.

This book is written very well and gives you a history lesson as well as depicting each use of all 48 laws of power. Some lessons can be used day to day, while some may take some time to apply effectively. It gives you the transgression of each law and the reversal which is greatly helpful, so you don't get caught in anothers trap or so you can avoid a backfire of your plan. This book revolves around the concept of deceit. So if your not comfortable with lying and deceiving, than this book is not for you.

Ok, let's say you want to read simply because you are bored. This book is filled full of factual stories about every law to show you how the law has been used throughout history. Extremely interesting stories about houdini, casanova, napoleon, Tallyrand, pt barnum, and a bunch of chinese people. Plus many many more. Freaking awesome book of stories.Besides the stories, each lesson will improve your life. Some laws will be more important than others, but they will help you become a more respected person overall.  You only have power if people like you and want to follow you. These lessons make people like you, therefore you can influence people better.

The 48 laws of power may not be nice, they may not be what you aspire to, and they may not be the world in which you wish to live.  Unfortunately, Robert Greene has nailed down 48 truisms that need to be understood by anyone responsible for managing, leading, selling, cajoling or subjected to any of those things.Greene takes the best and worst of human psychology and masterfully integrates lessons from history, quotations from classical literature and an entertaining if somewhat pedantic writing style to make the reader alert to the approach.  Reminding this reviewer of the tone taken by Machiavelli in ""The Prince"", Greene aims to both instruct and entertain while not passing moral judgement on the contents.Learn the 48 laws.  Understand that they are derivative of our nature, sociology and psychology, and accept that the information in the book is useful - if at times unpleasant to comprehend.

my father is a narcIssist so I know their characteristics very well.This book is very deceitful, I suggest reading the book by just reading the first page of every law. This book is not for the betterment of humanity, but a book for the ego mind.5 stars because the book serves as an eye opener to a many loop holes to ""power"". We do not want power. We just need to understand it.Read every law. The book should only take you minutes to read or less than a day. You only need to know it's laws not become it. Our world need better members of society that are open minded and are not subjugated to corruption.

I refer to this book often when I have a work problem.  I have learned how to exercise restraint in what I say at work, how to delegate, and how to appear more powerful and confident than I really am.  Some of the advice you have to take with a grain of salt if you are not a ""master manipulator""; however, it sheds some great light on the power struggles of history and how to apply them to modern day.  I don't share this book with many people, as I like to keep my strategies close to my chest, but it really helps to anticipate others' power plays and avoid pitfalls of being the ""victim"".

one of the best book about these matters. Only the 36 chinese stratagems can be defined as more intuitive (even if more difficult to understand in everyday life). This book will unveil a bitter truth about human beings: all human beings, included your family, your friends, colleagues...all of us search for personal satisfaction, which could be money, sex, political power. Based on this assumption, a lot of behaviours could be observed. Most of them have common roots. This book not only list them but give you clear and (interesting) examples, through human history. Which is to say: hey guys, we all know that this sucks, but we are not the only ones to behave in this way...look at Napoleon, Talleyrand, Sun Tzu, look at Michelangelo, etc, etc. As Baldasar Gracian said (also reported into this book)...most of our power in society is not based on what we DO, but on what we avoid to DO. I suggest this work without any basic arguments.

This is no doubt one of the best books I've read along with Greene's Art of Seduction, but truth be told it ends there its just a good read, more than the content, if you look at the perspective that Greene employs, its actually very grim, it makes it seem like every one out there is using each other, you also have to use the people around you to survive. Now that is really destructive, like covey says ""our perceptive governs the way we see, and how we see governs the way we behave"", I read this book several years back and I can guarantee you, if you try to employ these means you wont be able to trust anybody and nobody will trust you either, if fact you'll become extremely suspicious of everyone's motives, things get complicated.How I would suggest you read this book is, read it for fun, these laws and their stories are very admirable but also understand them and ask a lot of questions as in ""why does this work?"", ""could I have used this in the past"", and once you're done with it, forget the law, just dont even think of it. Your mind is so beautiful, if you truly and deeply understand something, at the right time in your life, your mind will furnish you with it. So just understand it the content, enjoy his perspective and don't get sucked into it.And remember always in life, what you give is what you get.

From the second a friend of mine handed me his copy of this book, dog eared and highlighted throughout, I knew that I needed a copy. Since ordering it, I have done the exact same thing.Robert Greene outdoes himself in this work. His books are always pragmatic and geared towards realists. These laws that he describes are wonderful ways for dealing with even the smallest details of your life. Knowing when to speak up, knowing when to speak out, and knowing how to bring out the best qualities in yourself and others are integral parts of the business and social world today.Added to these tenets are stories of the laws in practice. What happens when you try to make your boss look bad? It happened to this person. Too shy to speak up - this is what happens. Need to re-invent yourself at work? Watch how this person did it.There is a situation for nearly every part of your life. And you will see in your own life places to apply these principles. And how to succeed with them.Disclaimer - if you’re a rosy optimist, this book is not for you. I handed to my wife, who amounted it to a book on manipulating people. It definitely isn’t, but it WILL show you how to maximize your potential.

Yes the book deals with power and the keys to gain power in Machiavellian terms but the game of power is cutthroat like that.

This book, as suggested by the title, is not just about  power. It is also a great source of history lessons for people who likes to take a glimpse of the past.  Robert Greene’s ability to provide concrete historical examples  of each and every laws,  (although I would much rather refer to it as fLaws of Power) gives him an honest convincing edge than any other writers who chose to write about power. I appreciate the brutal honesty of this book! It is like an actual manual for people who really wants to take a hold of power and be an absolute ruler of all!  (The type of people who can live with themselves knowing they gotta employ those tactics to stay on top).If you like historical figures and psychology I would definitely recommend this book.I would also recommend this to book to people who despise mind games and manipulative tactics played by people. It will teach you a valuable lesson or two on how to deal with it! It is an eye opening reality that happens everyday. As such, know yourself before reading this book, coz you may not come up the same after reading it.

I have recommended and bought multiple copies of this book for many friends. Once you read it, it's like someone removed dark glasses from in front of your eyes. Suddenly history makes sense to me and politics even more. This book is not a novel and actually reads like a text book. It is amoral meaning that the information in it can be used either way. Not IMMORAL where the information can only be used for evil. The example I give is like this: This book is like money. One can used it to help others or use it to buy weapons to kill. Morality comes from your application of the knowledge. Gandhi was a master of the information in here, so was Napoleon and even Hitler. Don't read it fast. Take your time. It will change you too (for the better).

Anecdotal mostly.The 44 rules of power is not only a guide for war and conflict, but also a practical explanation of how the rules can be applied to everyday life in both business and personal interaction.  There are several examples of the rules as expressed in history. Each chapter has references from modern day business moguls to ancient Chinese warlords.If we can't learn from people such as Lincoln, Galileo and Napoleon, who can we learn from? If the greatest people of the last few hundred years cannot teach us, who can teach us?

William J. Bahr,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
Almost like a certain biblical tree, this highly popular book impresses me as almost akin to the “Book of Good and Evil,” maybe even a close cousin to Machiavelli’s “The Prince.”  As I read through this 452-page collection of 48 power laws, I personally rated them into the following categories (one law was split):  Good (27%), Bad (30%), and Ugly (43%, which could go either way to follow the crowd).  As far as archetypes, one could translate this split into a good George Washington, a bad Hitler, and maybe a run-of-the-mill, somewhat unprincipled modern politician. Also, some of the laws looking to be Bad on the surface appear to be just Ugly, given that the examples of the law subsequently provided soften the apparent top-level advice to do harm.  And some laws seem to contradict other laws, leaving one wondering which ones to follow.Yes, these strategies are said to work to accrue power, but to what end?  Are you trying to build up a positive world for everyone, or raise yourself up while destroying it and hoping you’re dead and gone before it comes crashing down upon you and everyone else?As you may recall, Machiavelli’s “The Prince” is one of the first works of modern political philosophy, purporting to share “the truth” rather than ideals.  The term “Machiavellian” is now viewed as a pejorative. However, if one recalls George Washington's words, he frequently used the word “interest” to determine how people and peoples (nations) are motivated. Indeed, even Machiavelli urged princes to construct compelling arguments. Thus, power is always and ultimately about persuasion, whether convincing others to work with you or to explain to adversaries the consequences if they do not.  Addressing “interest” then is frequently just a “carrot and/or stick” proposition.However, on the positive side about the book’s negative side, at least it helps one with Good character learn about what Bad characters might try!  Therefore, all in all, I highly recommend even Good guys take a tasteful bite of this good/evil book!Of possible interest:

I've tried to read this book for almost 4 months now, have restarted it twice after losing interest entirely and it feels like a chore to read. It's like the author read Art of War, took something hallucinogenic and then went to writing. Perhaps in politics some of this may apply. But if you implement even half of what this book advises, you will succeed only in becoming a psychopath and push everyone around you away. Any time I've been seen reading this book and people ask what it's about, I have no idea what to tell them. Despite reading and re-reading and re-analyzing the first 19 ""laws"" I cannot understand why this book makes lists with so many great ones that you might actually get something from. There seems to be a culture in literature of garbage like this where people pretend to ""get it"" and that laws of ancient wisdom involving trust and decepit and military tactics somehow improve their life working 9-5 in an office, sitting on a computer all day. I personally have gained nothing from this book in spite of spending probably an accumulative 20 hours reading it thus far.This book will now make a very short list of mine, a list of books I absolutely could not get through and wound up discarding:-Love Yourself Like Your Life Depends On It-The 48 Laws of Power

Many of us are told growing up that the world is a utopian place and to adjust our behaviors accordingly. We told to ""treat others how you want to be treated"", ""turn the other cheek"", ""everything happens for a reason and works out in the end"" and ""pardise awaits us after we die"".Most people realize that this view of the world, especially once they leave the nest, is in fact false. There is suffering and death occurring on scales at the moment that are beyond human comprehension (nature has a 99% extinction rate). People are, and quite willing, to hurt and use you for their own ends. And that if you expect to get anywhere in the world you have todo more than work hard and be kind, you must hustle, be lucky and sometimes use and push people aside.Robert Greene in ""The 48 Laws of Power"" is first and foremost making you aware of the way the world is. Not as we want it to be but as it is. He goes through 48 ""laws"", which are really just techniques/actions, that people use to protect themselves, advance their own interest and ""gain power"". Each chapter starts with short description of the law and then proceeds to detail the law through accompanying stories and reasoning.Overall I feel the author has created an absolute masterpiece. He's engaging, articulate, funny and smart in his writing. Personally once I really got into the book I couldn't put it down. I found myself reflecting back on my own experiences, those close to me and society at large and I saw people utilizing the laws all the time (whether they know they are is a different story). I was also suprised, in a good way, at just how diverse and applicable they were to so many different areas of your everyday life.The only real downsides I found with the book is that it is long (probably unnecessarily so) and a bit depressing (since the laws can and often are used for evil). But that's a complaint about human nature, not the authors fault.So what is the real purpose of the book, what do people take away from and use it for? Well the laws are really just like a diverse tool kit to be used at different times in your life. So first and foremost it's about awareness and protecting yourself. Even if you don't use the laws, or at least don't intend to use them in a bad way, other people will try to use them on you and you can adequately defend and protect yourself. As they say ""a ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure"" to any problem/conflict.Second it's about using them to advance your own interests. And this where the negative reviews are entirely unwarranted. Any weapon or tool, such as a car, is not itself good or evil. Only the person wielding it is. So you can use them for good or evil. And at the end of the day really is their anything wrong with protecting and advancing you own interests (if they are noble)? The answer is no and if you want to do anything meaningful in life you must both defend and attack.Another thing, for those still hesitant on reading the book, is this. In recovery from any major problem there is typically five steps people go through (whether they know they are going through them or not). They are ""Denial"", ""Anger"", ""Bargaining"", ""Depression"" & ""Acceptance"". This is what you will likely go through with this book. At first you'll ""deny"" the laws, you'll become ""angry"" as you see that they are in fact true and be utilizing people (how awful they are for doing so), you will start to use them for yourself and see results (""Bargaining""), ""depressed"" as you come to terms that they really work and used for evil in some cases (why does it have to be this way) and lastly you'll ""accept"" that this is just how the world works and your better of knowing about them and using them for both defense and offense.Do you want to be a victum the rest of your life and be used, abused and hurt and left behind? Or do you want to Man (or Woman) Up to the world so you can survive and thrive in it? The answer is obvious. I have seen people, including myself, get used, abused and hurt (in some cases ending in death) because they were unaware of these laws or refused to let go of the utopian/disney view of the world. Grow up or get left behind.As Saint Paul said ""When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child; but when I became a man, I put away childish things."".I would recommend you check out Greene's other books in particular ""The 33 Stratgies of War"" and the ""The 50th Law"" (with 50 Cent). The help complete your personal technique arsenal for effective defense and offense.My last piece of advise is to follow the unwritten ""49th law"" which is ""to not talk about the laws of power"". It is to your advatge for others not to know this stuff as they will often use it agaist you or they will resent you because they may think your using it on them. (This is the real motivation behind a lot of the negative reviews, they don't want you to know them because they put themselves at a disadvantage). I would only educate perhaps your children and a long term significant other as you want them to be protected and thrive as well. However if you can be sure you safe from harm you may want to pass it on (as someone likely did to you since your reading this review). But again be wary, when so many other people suck it makes it easier for you to stand out. As they say a good magacian never revels their secrets.

Hello,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
When I first was reading the book’s review I was thinking I have to read this book because I wanted to know what made some one say it was a book of pure evil. This book is great it helps you understand the mindset of most Americans and how to be an American. A typical grimy one. I saw a post on Facebook it said “I went to a party and was amazed at how many people took 3 slices of pizza because they thought it would run out and amazed by how many only took 1 because of that same reason.” I have always been the sucker to take one and leave extras for every one else to be “fair”. This book helped me realize looking out for everyone else is a set back. It was a quick revolution actually something I needed to read. My mom always said kindness gets you a long way. No it does not. Kindness brings turmoil in your life. There are so many events in my life that I can reflect on and say why being genuinely kind was more of a hindrance than anything even though I was not seeking a direct benefit at the time. A book of pure evil? Quite possibly, but I live in a country of pure evil.

This book teaches you about your ""Power"" and how to recognize it in everything you do, especially your profession.  It teaches you humility and humbleness and how powerful that is when it's applied.  I have two other books in this series and am in the process of reading them all.  This particular book does not need to be read cover to cover.  You can read on the ""48 Laws"" as they interest you, not only as the book is written.

I live by this book IDC how evil it makes me. The world isn't rainbows and fairies. It's corrupt and everyone is out for themselves. So might as well take that lead and take your power no matter what because no one else is going to give that to you, they'd much rather take your power than give you a sliver. Humanity is rotten. So use it to your advantage like everyone else does and get ahead by whatever means necessary. Don't forget the humans around you would take everything you have if it meant they had some power so, screw humanity and step on heads and go succeed by any means necessary. Period.

There are a lot of other great reviews on here, including the 1 star reviews (which is unusual...) so I'll let people be a lot more vocal than me in describing the pros and cons of this book.I think there is a difference between liking the material in this book, and having respect for it's contents and construction.  The book is very well written, but it's contents may be offensive to certain people and a gold mine to others.There is no doubt that anyone putting these tactics and principles to work in their everyday life will result in them being something of a sociopath and a megalomanic.  If you are an incredibly ambitious person who seeks power and domination at all costs, then this book will be your bread and butter!  (I am NOT one of those people.)However, even if you find the inner workings of this book offensive and anti-social, the books is STILL valuable as a resource that you can use to find out what games other people are playing against YOU.  In that respect, I would still put this book high on a list of books you should read.  If you want to swim with the sharks and not get eaten, this book will illuminate what you need to look for to protect yourself from ambitious power mongers.If you really want to have personal power without resorting to Machiavellian tactics, I would recommend ""Aikido In Everyday Life"" by Terry Dobson and Victor Miller.  That book shows how to use the principles of the martial art Aikido to be strong and in harmony with others (and to totally kick ass in almost any situation!) without having to be an upward mobility seeker or sociopathic power monger.If you want to be a U.S. Senator, then THIS book is for you!  (Yes, I am disgusted with our government.)Peace!

If you want to understand what’s happening in our current society and culture, and grasp how those in power got there and what they intend, this book is a step-by-step strategy. Obviously someone has read it and is using it as their game plan.Read this work and your eyes will suddenly open to what’s happening in the world. There’s a reason this book was banned from prisons, and from some universities. If you learn and implement these strategies effectively, you will gain great power. And even if you do not implement these laws, you’ll come to understand how others are using them.This book should be required reading and study.

There are people who are so narcissistic and so ruthless that they will stop at nothing to get what they want, no matter how many people they harm on the way. This book will help you to recognize some of the patterns of behavior utilized by the excessively ambitious.One shortcoming of the book, I think, is that in some cases, the author used certain criminals and their endeavors as examples of successful acquisition of power. Surely, there would be many examples in the ""legal"" business community that would have served as well or better.

Robert Greene does it again. This book is filled with true ""laws"" that you can observe in everyday society. Regardless if you agree if the laws are ""right or wrong"" morally is beside the point. These laws are a bit dark and somewhat Machiavellian but they are very applicable to modern day society. Knowing the laws from this book will help you understand the dynamics of power, how to use it, or how to defend yourself from those that try to use it against you. Even if you aren't looking to gain power, this book is still eye opening. I highly recommend this book to anyone.

This is a 14 year-old book that I, then my wife read. After 1330 reviews, what else might possibly be said?We'll ... maybe a lot. Notice that the reviews have trended up toward 5 stars after a sketchy 3-5 star beginning 13 years ago. Are the 48 Laws of Power more relevant now than 13 years ago?Reviewer's terms have morphed from using words like `evil' in some form to `practical' and `useful' today.  Are readers more aligned to the 48 Laws then they were in 2000?My wife and I have our own book club thing going so we've spent some time chatting about Greene's 48 Law's. We agree first, that Lucifer and the demons of Hell should have gotten some of the credits in the intro. However, Greene elucidates the Hellion's strategies so well that they are likely enthralled by the result since the low key, take no credit for injecting is one of the laws. That's not to say that we mere humans don't execute the possibilities of this list of management style temptations ... at least 2 or 3 a day ... maybe more.We agree second that the 48 Laws of Power is a masterpiece. It describes the ways and means to reap what you sow. it is so exceedingly rare that an author sticks to such ancient tried and true methods that really work without messing them up with ""New"" or ""Improved"" notions. This is hard core wisdom for the power seekers and office warriors.  You can love it or hate it simultaneously. Nonetheless,  it is worthy simply because it is so spot on for offence or defense in a wholly secular world.Great value for money ... a long read.

The 48 Laws of PowerAs a professor of business psychology and communications in an accelerated leadership program at New York's Mercy College, I chose this book as a text for one of my courses.  My students are adults returning to college to complete their degrees, so they have rich life experiences.  Some of the Laws shocked them (for example, Law 6:  ""Court Attention at All Cost""), while others were in sync with their own encounters (for example, Law 32: ""Play to People's Fantasies."")  Whether they agreed with each Law or not, my students began to think in new ways--about their personal ethics and those of their families, acquaintances and business associates.  They questioned how far the end should justify the means toward their goals. They compared The Laws to my book, ""Don't Bet on the Prince!  How to Have the Man You Want by Betting on Yourself,"" and noted similarities in the realm of male/female power that would have seemed so distinct at first glance.  It was a great thinking and learning experience, and I would use The 48 Laws of Power again in other courses.

I wish I had read this book 30 years ago. I do believe I would have behaved differently in the office. I did attain the position of Director in several companies but I am sure I could have been more successful with this knowledge and understanding. I always expected people to play fairly and that is my downfall. No one plays fairly. I was one of those who believed hard work and team playing were keys to success. What corporations tell you are lies. It is every person for themselves. Read this book!!!

So entertaining,, full of history and detailed accounts.Complaint: I  try to follow a story,  then the author cuts it off and interjects a completely different story before completing the original one. It's the most annoying thing about this book. If he's doing it to increase interest,  or power,  it didn't work on me. I already enjoy this book,  no need for that trick.Praise: in a world of humans full of ego,  the author gives valuable insight into human behavior. Some of it really doesn't apply nowadays like (crush your enemy completely), really,  does anyone kill their own children like that Chinese Empress that did anything to destroy her competition to the throne. Still I'm fascinated by human behavior so even these crazier stories were interesting to me.I consider myself very protective of innocents from deceptive individuals.  What better way to become a strong protector than by understanding the dark side of humanity.Ps. Not everything suggested will work. For example ""If you want to seduce a woman,  court her sister first- Stehndal "". Someone i already liked tried this on me,  as soon as he mentioned my sister or any other women i banished him from my life. I know he's in pain rn and i love it.

A must read for all Divine Feminine Goddesses and Empaths. I recommend that you have access to a ""website"" while reading so you can find out about the ""rest"" of the story. For instance, the Bible tells of Cryus the Great who helped the children of Israel rebuild the temple (I think this story in the bible is a metaphor) but did you know a Woman Queen Warrior defeated Cyrus of the Babylonian empire, which the book The Secret speaks.  Her name Tomyris and she was of Iranian descent. Divine Feminine's and those of us who don't understand how the Game of Life is played need to get this book. I especially recommend this book for young woman whether you plan to be a work at home mother or business entrepreneur, either way it will help you avoid the pitfalls in life or help you when you fall into the pit with your eyes wide open how to recover and get out. Great read. Thank you, FREQUENCYPHOENIX555 for recommending this book. 😇🙏💖

While this book is a useful compilation of historical stories, it dangerously also poses as a modern manual for human behavior - a task at which it abysmally fails. We have the book on our coffee table and open it any time we need a good laugh. Anyone looking to understand human behavior, power dynamics and network effects would be better off reading books based on research and modern science, since we no longer live in the dark ages. Adam Grant and Brenee Brown are good starting points.

Robert Greene enfoca y usa como ejemplo a estafadores o personas viles, sin embargo, cada una de las leyes del poder si tienen una aplicación útil. Me explico, para Robert lo importante es obtener poder, sin embargo, es un poder insostenible considerando los engaños, la hipocresía, entre otros. Cuando sumas todas las recomendaciones te das cuenta que el verdadero poder está en transformar nuestro carácter para desarrollar comportamientos reales y no fingidos. En ese sentido, si se puede desarrollar poder con cada una de las leyes de tal forma que sea sostenible y duradero. Aunque la aplicación más evidente es a nivel empresarial, considero que es útil para todas nuestras áreas de vida.

Read this book. This is the most realistic book I’ve ever read. I’ve read countless of self-help books before I read a book like this. I’m pretty sure Robert Greene did the same. It will make you aware of what the evil is up to. When you know what the evil is up to, you can most definitely defeat the evil every time. That is true power and self-improvement.

JSJ,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
“The 48 Laws of Power” is a guide to human behavior. In the real world, life is not always about fairness and honor. The most fair, virtuous, and honorable do not always come out on top. Sometimes they do but many times they don’t because someone else has power over them. This book helps you understand human behavior with examples from history and from the psychological perspective. When you get caught up in someone’s power play, you need to be aware of the situation and how you can avoid it or extract yourself from it. You can also apply the laws when it’s appropriate for you.The takeaway from “The 48 Laws of Power” is to be objective and to divorce your emotions from the situation. Some laws are relevant to you while others are not. What’s important to be aware of these laws of power. As I was reading, current examples of these laws came to mind. This understanding and insight will make it less scary dealing with uncertainty in present situations.

Joel D. Smith,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
If you enjoy history, psychology, sociology and the dynamics of relationships you'll love this book.  Greene's work has the focus of Machiavelli's, The Prince, but is written in a voice similar to Dale Carnegie's, How to Win Friends and Influence People.  There's lots of practical advice with loads of examples to help everyone from the aspiring tyrant to the school teacher to the middle manager to the parent.  If you can get past the promotion of power (which I suspect is satirical like Machiavelli) there's much really good advice here to keep from being taken advantage of by people in power over you or those below you trying to pull themselves up at your expense.  So, read it, but don't take the admonition to power too seriously.

Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
An uncanny and straightforward analysis of the ways of the world and how to navigate them to bring about the most fortuitous conclusion. As a sociology major in my school days, this book perfectly captures the essence of the sociological imagination described by C. Wright Mills: no individual has power except when we comprehend our position in society, where it is heading, and how we can join with others in shaping that trajectory. That said, many if not most of these laws can easily be used for manipulation and deceit, and some may be inherently inconsistent with honesty and fairness. For those who reject machiavellianism and seek to be loved rather than feared, this book will nonetheless help the reader identify where and how underhanded people work and can take measures to hinder their progress, if not stop them outright. The game of power is one we all must play, whether we choose to or not (much like ""the game""). What we do with power and how we share it determines the outcome.

48 Laws of Power is a classic snake oil book. It claims to have Laws, but each chapter points out the swathes of exceptions to each Law. Furthermore, the laws blatantly contradict one another. The result is a book full of anecdotes attempting to prove contradictory rules. The book instructs the reader to be a cutthroat, emotionless, calculating manipulator to succeed. I will not argue with that conclusion, but it is not the only path in life. For fun, here are some of the 48 laws that contradict one another:Law 6 - Court attention at all cost (""all attention is good attention"")Law 5 - So much depends on reputation - Guard it with your life--------So he advises to bang pots and pans together, but to avoid getting a bad reputation. Great.Law 7 - Get others to do work for you, and always take the creditLaw 11 - Learn to keep people dependent on you--------In other words, sometimes you should make people do all the work, and sometimes you should garner a reputation for doing all the work and being reliable. Great advice.Law 4 - Always say less than necessary (to appear smart by letting people imagine you know more)Law 46 - Never appear to perfect-----------So you should pretend to be omniscient but not perfectly omniscientLaw 34 - Be royal in your own fashion: act like a king to be treated like oneLaw 38 - Think as you like but behave like others-----------Unless everyone is a king, this is plainly absurd.Before you buy this book for laughs, keep in mind that if you follow these rules, smart people around you that read similar concepts as a defensive measure (like myself) will immediately write you off as a sociopath that is not worth connecting with, befriending, or respecting. Power is not the only value in the social marketplace.

I don't know why anyone would rate this book less than 3 starsThe only reason I can think of is that those people are afraid to face the world as it is and prefer to cover the sun with one fingerThis book is crafted with the best real stories from history greatest triumphant leaders and common peopleThis book is what I would call a real 'self help book' giving great advice on mostly how to be aware of the wolves out there that want to take advantage of you, even your most loved ones. But also you might be able to practice the laws yourself, not abusing of course, because like it says in the introduction the game of power is very tricky.Moreover, this book is nothing like the rubbish offered in other kinds of self help books like 'wishful thinking' and new religions

Make notes, write comments in the margins, and visualize where in your life you could've used it, and where you will utilize the wisdom within. Forget at your peril.

This is a great peek into how psychology and manipulation is used and shouldn’t be used. I thought it was interesting to read, the laws point out long term consequences and effects of actions that people usually never think of. Most of us are short sighted or do things without thinking and then wonder why our consequences..are our consequences. I take what’s pointed out as mostly a grain of salt, I like to think life is more about loving and being loved in a healthy way rather than about manipulation and power. A lot of the laws are relatable and did provide me with enlightenment in some of my past failures/successes.

Stephen M. Fragale,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
I struggled whether to give this book 3 or 4 stars but ultimately I enjoyed the stories and history lessons but was annoyed by all the authors interruptions with side notes and comments and interpretations. I think the stories and histories in the book were strong enough on their own and didn't really require so many interjections.I know this is a book about POWER and it's a part of human life and interactions among humans but the author paints a rather negative and depressing picture about humanity. Surely there are other emotions and qualities that we posses and that motivate us besides this lust for POWER and the need to deceive and if we are to believe the author all our motives and desires are tied to this need, lust for POWER. I would maintain that the human condition is much more complex than that and there is an influx of motivations and emotions that are in play in all of us and that POWER and the need or desire for POWER is only one of many. Many of the historical examples depict murder, lies, deceit, robbery, criminal acts, etc. Again, this is part of humanities history and surely there is much to be learned from this history. But would I want to model my life after any of these people? Probably not. Doesn't it mean i'm in denial about my so called need for POWER? I don't know...maybe? To me the ultimate POWER is knowledge. Learning. And learning not just from books or school but from life.I don't want to make it seem like I hated the book because I certainly didn't. I learned a lot. But if I compare it to the other book I read by Robert Green, Mastery, in my opinion the former was much better!

I have had a copy of this book for years but keep having to buy a new copy as people visit my home and want to read it.  I give it to them as a gift and just purchase another.  If you are a corporate type, it is definitely a must read.  You will quickly learn the personalities of the people around you and how to deal with them and see how they deal with you--the games people play.  For me it is not a means for trying to manipulate people but merely to understand the human psyche.

I couldn’t make it past the first few pages of this book. Based on the 1st piece of advice which is “never outshine your master”, I closed it. But then decided to give it another chance. The advice just didn’t get better for me. Based on the table of contents, there may be a few jewels inside this book but I am looking to become a BETTER person & this book just seems as if it can turn someone into an complete a-hole who burn bridges to those who love them & kiss up to those above them. But to each it’s own, everyone is on their own journey so based on your path, this book will or will not be a good fit for you.

B. Wilson,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
Some people read the laws by themselves and think that this book is a guide on how to play dirty. It is not. The 48 laws are just that, laws. You learn from true historical stories of how these laws have played out in the past, and how to avoid them playing out in your future. Each ""Law""has its own chapter. When you read a chapter, I can almost guarantee that you can relate it to someone, or something that you have experienced in life or business. This in not a quick read, but, it's a good one.

PD,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
I must admit, I am a little embarrassed of having bought this book.  After the first 11 “Laws” it has become clear to me that I was suckered.  The very idea that there could be 48 “Laws of Power” is really laughable if you think about it.  But, still, one might hope to get something profound out of it.  This work could far more appropriately be labeled “How to Be The Biggest Jerk in Any Room” or maybe “48 Fairy Tales of Power.”The authenticity of the stories presented I find very suspect.  They often read to me as loose collections of facts strung carefully together in a manner advantageous to the author.  There are no footnotes indicating any sources to investigate.  There are quotes from Sun Tzu and such that I am reasonably sure are perfectly legitimate.  But to pull concepts together in this manner strikes me now as disingenuous to say the least.If it is true that this book was banned in several prisons, that likely isn’t because of any ‘secret’ or ‘utterly profound’ insights.  It is probably because some of the inmates might actually believe this garbage and get themselves or others killed.There may be scattered insights here and there into human psychology depending on your background.  And there may be some value in reading this just for entertainment.  But please do not buy this book thinking that it is academically legitimate in much any sense.

Additionally, gain greater appreciation for the genuinely good people in your life, as they are rare. The book is a tremendous lesson in human nature and human history.

If you don’t know by now, your brain is the most powerful organ in your body. This book has 48 laws to sync into your brain.

This book was great. Some of the laws I had experienced first hand in life and once I read the book, it gave more clarity. The breakdown of each law with stories from the past of how people used those laws. The side notes of excerpts of other books were a nice touch. I would definitely recommend this book for anyone planning on being in any type of leadership role or manager of something. It will save a lot of headaches. The book defines explains and illustrates every law and gives reversal of laws at the end. Great book!

Growing up we are taught to get good grades, work hard, etc, and you will move up. That's the lie. It's really these 48 laws that matter IF you want to advance in an organization. ALL organizations are political even if you don't see it or want to see it.This is a book about getting ahead in a political world. This is a book about advancing in corporate or government politics. I don't really care for these types of books or ""playing the game,"" but if you want to advance in the game, this is the road-map. After working 15 years in a government bureaucracy, I can vouch that these 48 laws are 100% true. It took me many years to realize these were the only rules that matter matter in organizations and it is disappointing news for idealistic people. The book is fantastic information even if you choose not to participate in the game.My only criticism is some of the dated stories used to support the laws can get boring at times. It's hard to relate our modern reality to times of the past, even if they completely apply.

This is an excellent study of how power is used. I really liked the format. You can either read it cover to cover or pick out the laws that apply to your situation. There are many laws that I would never engage in myself but it's good to know them so that you can see when they're being used against you. It will surprise you how often that happens in social transactions that you normally wouldn't give much thought to.The other thing I liked about this book is how the author used snippets from the literary world in the margins of the book that pertained to the law being explored. This was a novel approach to make the points he was trying to make.

I bought this book because I am working on an English adaptation of Cardinal Jules Mazarin Breviarium Politicorum (to be published soon), a classic of the ""power literature"" in. the late 1600s. The 48 Laws of Power is a must-have colossal piece of work. It combines case studies throughout the ages, lessons, anecdotes, and recommendations. Its layout is an example of clarity and effectiveness. It will remain a classic in the ""power literature.""

As someone that doesn't spend much time reading in my free time, The 48 Laws of Power has been a refreshing wake-up call to what I have been missing. The content is digestible and intriguing, to say the least. Each chapter is broken up into a couple anecdotes, usually an observance of the law and a transgression of the law, which are followed by brief explanations. The last part of the chapter is a reversal of the law, addressing special cases where the law shouldn't be followed or could be followed incorrectly. I highly recommend this book!

In reading the 48 laws of power, I found myself reflecting on times when I had not observed them. Prior to reading this book I found many points in my life where I had been frustrated by how my dealings with other people had not gone as I would have liked. Now in hindsight I have a greater ability to understand why things played out the way they did.This book is not a ""how to"" guide. It's a window into how people behave, valuable insight into the human psyche. I really enjoyed it and would highly recommend!

I have only gotten through 13 of the 48 rules so far.  I plan to read the rest of it because I need to knock the innocence and naïveté out of my system.  Excellent so far in the sense that it provides a map for the attainment of purely personal power and “achievement”.However…I am not religious.  I am actually an unbeliever. But this book feels…don’t cringe…EVIL.As the title yo my review suggests, it feels like the subtitle should be, “The Devil’s Handbook”.  The book examines how one should act if one’s only consideration is the “Self”.  It provides instruction with the presumption that others are only tools for the reader’s self-actualization.  Others are to be manipulated and used.As that appears to be the goal of the book…we’ll done so far.But I can’t shake the great discomfort I get from reading this…as if my soul is being compromised.I believe a book that would be that antithesis of this book would entitled, “HONOR and INTEGRITY”

I'm using this book in order to not repeat history; To be able to detect and avoid certain people in life. You're able to use this book for good personal gain and not malicious intent. It all depends on how you view it and your purpose for reading it.

This should be required reading for anyone who needs to deal with people in their profession (almost everyone). Some say it's evil, but in the end it's all in how you use it right? If you're scared it'll make you a bad person it won't. If you're already a bad person, well, remember your good old friend from the Amazon review section before you take over the world.Anyways, it really is a good, necessary read that will do nothing but help you navigate our society. Plus there's LOTS of history lessons for those into that.

This was a book that I’ve heard things about for years, a lot of them positive and then a lot of the negative depending on the person typically. Some said that it was about mind control and using people but just from some of the chapters I’ve read I don’t really see that I can see where they feel that way about certain laws but others are very real and it’s just hard reality to swallow for some people. Law 10 was one that really resonated with me in the situation I was currently going through at the moment with a person who is miserable and literally it was Word for Word what the person did and acted like. And the repercussions that I was suffering from a completely true so I highly recommend the book despite the controversy obviously take what you read with a grain of salt some of the things are Pretty dark but that doesn’t mean you have to follow it that way or you can interpret it differently.

Andrew,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
The reviews on whether this book is moral or not aren't relevant: Greene makes excellent use of historical examples in proving each law, and history is based on facts rather than morals. Each law has been historically demonstrated, and a plethora of laws are plainly visible in the world today. A fantastic read on the different manifestations of power, how those have come to pass in history, and how you can usurp them (to a degree) for your own purposes. It spurred me to buy three other Greene books. Highly recommend, at the very least so you can become aware of how power manifests itself.

I wish I had found this book years ago as a parent, but somehow my 17 year old son came across it and read it and enjoyed it. Authors use of stories about historical figures to describe concepts helps to keep readers interest. It sparked many a conservation between me and my son. I liked it because it helped my son to understand many of the things I I have tried to teach him as he was growing up. It has helped look at and deal with people in a more sophisticated and mature way. In fact, he has has tells me he has been more successful using concepts when playing video games that involve complex social interactions. I am given serious thought on buying more copies to give to my  two other sons as a book they can keep their entire lives.

Whether you are a narcissist or sociopath looking to perfect your game, or just a decent human being trying to survive in a world of narcissists and sociopaths, everyone can benefit from studying the 48 laws.Some of the advice is controversial, and often even contradictory. For example, you are encouraged to protect your reputation at all costs, because once it's gone, there is no getting it back. But, in the very next chapter, the reader is told that there is no such thing as bad publicity, and it is sometimes good to invite scandal. I took off a star because I the book needs to be updated to address issues like social media and cancel culture.The author points out that we are all playing this game. People can piously claim that they are opting out, but in fact they are just losing. As distasteful as that is, I can't disagree with him.

Hey online shoppersThe 48 laws of power is a great book. I'm still reading it. This book can be applied to diffrent walk of life. I used it to have leverage over my coworkers and my girlfriend. The best rule in my opinion is Win Through Actions not Argument. You can look up all 48 laws on any search engine but to grasp the full message you have to buy the book. It will start worjing for you as soon as you get it. Its my daily guide in this world of corruption and power. Guard yourself against power, gain power or lose it. This book shows you how to.

You become the animal that you feed, and it’s yours alone to deal with when all is done, no one else’s.  The book did give me some explanations of the behavior of others that make a lot of sense. If power is about stealing and obtaining something you don’t have, undermining others, I’m going to seek out those who nurture and build things into existence from what previously did not seem apparent. There is the real wealth. Where are the power seekers going to obtain their wealth after they have mined all the human capital if someone isn’t nurturing it somewhere?

This is a book about how to be a terrible person in order to get ahead in life. If thats the kind of person you want to be then read it. But it I could not even get half way through the book before throwing it in revulsion at what it suggests you do to get ahead in life. Basically lie cheat do whatever you have to do in order to get what you want no matter who you hurt.

I could write A LOT of great things about this book, but I'll just keep it simple:Wether you think you're interested in power or not, you have to read this book.Because from the moment you begin to read it, you'll (a) have your mind blow and (b) begin to truly understand what motivates people.Some of the rules will seem natural to you (i.e. Don't bite the hand that feeds), but others are far more eloquent.If you learn these lessons - truly learn them - you will avoid countless problems, and will come out the winner in a power struggle.

Excellent book. One it arrived in excellent condition. Two, regarding its content - I tend to use the right side of my brain more then my left. The book gave me perspective I hadn’t considered. Or perhaps I had and hearing someone else say it validated as the book uses historical facts to defend each law of power. If you are a righty like me, and would like to become more intouch with your right I recommend it. Too much if any one type of thinking can provoke us to be radical, always healthy to keep an open mind and consider the opposition. Also, don’t read ahead! ;-)

M. A. ZAIDI,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
The book deals with each of the 48 laws with a very wide selection of parables, myths, anecdotes and stories from all over the world and form all times, illustrating the unchanging dynamics of power over the centuries. It features Chinese warlords, Roman and renaissance-Italian power-mongers, American and European conmen, famous courtiers from the French courts before the Revolution, and even musings by Thomas Edison. And of course, the book pays tribute to the power-writer of all time, Niccolo Machiavelli.Learning the game of power requires a certain way of looking at situations and shift of perspective. To master the art takes effort, which requires certain basic skills, once mastered one is able to apply the laws of power.  The most fundamental of this skill is the ability to master your emotions.  An emotional response to a situation is the greatest barrier to power, a mistake that will cost you a lot more than any temporary satisfaction you may gain by expressing your feelings.  Emotions cloud reason, and if you cannot see the situation clearly, you cannot prepare for and respond to it with any degree of control.Anger is the most destructive of the emotional responses, for it clouds your vision the most.  It has a ripple effect that invariable makes situation less controllable and heightens your enemy's resolve.  Love and emotions are potentially destructive in that they blind you to the often self-serving interests of those whom you least suspect.The writings by Greene are an essential guide to power play.  They can help one be astute, alert, manipulative, cunning and provide an ability to strategize with the end goal in mind.  A clear grasp and understanding of the situation is a must.  The rhythm of power requires an alteration of force and cunning.  Too much force creates a counter-reaction; too much cunning no matter how well thought makes it predictable.The 48 Laws of Power is very cynical and depicts a world without mercy. The book is written in a manner so as to inspire the reader to achieve great power with an iron fist by talking directly to the reader, much like a self-help tape. Despite this belligerent and unabating tone, and the fact that it takes over 500 pages to get through all the laws, it is very readable, very clear in its message and the laws in it are not to be easily refuted.

This popped up while I was tying to buy The Art Of War, so I bought it along side. For some reason  I had the idea going in that this was an ACTUAL 48 step guide used by world leaders. But in actuality it’s some random author’s manipulation bible, using history as a crutch. I guess I could see the 48 Laws being useful to a dictator, or a king, or really anyone in a position where power is necessary for survival. However to the average person, it holds little or no merit at all. These laws are wrong and unhealthy in everyday practice. personally would have at least wanted something written by a historical figure. The Art Of War gives me a direct look inside the mind of an ancient warlord and Without that that 48 Laws Of Power just feels more like a manipulator awareness book.

Book arrived in pristine condition. I do not normally read self-help books, and did not recognize this as one of them, but found it an interesting book, nonetheless. It appears to be an academic study of sociology and psychology relating to the study of power dynamics throughout history. Included are historical examples of observances and transgressions of each respective ""law,"" as well as parables, quotes, and other notes. While and after reading this, it is easy to view the world through the lens of power dynamics, and to find examples of these ""laws"" both in my own life and in modern history. A little dry at times and often cynical, it pulls no punches and makes its points clearly and without confusion.

I have the Kindle version for when I need to strategize on the go after encountering a new personality. You can't escape this game... Even if you're not trying to get ahead, you're a pawn in someone else's strategy. This book is an amazing tool for putting it all together.

This book has caused quite a stir it seems. First, if you're worried it's a guide on how to be a sociopath, well, it's not. BUT, this book does go over various ways to come out on top in situations that involve a balance of power, and it is very blunt about how to do just that (to some extent). Most of these laws require practice to use effectively - noone's going to pick up this book and BOOM - next Machiavelli.Also important to note is that the laws themselves are neither moral nor immoral. They can be used to do good and bad things, to harm or to protect others, etc. On that same note, I wouldn't want an actual narcissist/sociopath to EVER get their hands on a book like this. I wouldn't brag about the knowledge in this book openly, and I'd only share its contents with close friends and family. Best to not have something like this in the hands of the abusive and the controlling.I really enjoy the format of the book. Each law tends to go like this:Judgement - synopsis of the lawTransgression - historical story of someone who failed to follow the lawObservance - historical story of someone who successfully followed the lawKeys to Power - Greene goes on to explain in more detail about the law and its usageReversal - exceptions to the lawBoth Transgressions and Observances have an interpretation of them in which Greene (author) gives his input about the stories. There are also little quotes/stories written in red on the side of the pages, which I personally didn't care for much. Everything in the book's format allows the reader to continually see the law in use, which makes it easier to remember, along with the use of stories to really aide memory retention.I personally have read and took detailed/concise notes on laws 1-13 so far, and plan on finishing them all chronologically, but you don't need to read the book in this manner.This book teaches many important lessons on how to deal with people in so many different ways. Even if you couldn't apply every law efficiently, just knowing the techniques of those who may want to harm you gives you quite an advantage. If anything, this book should be read by altruistic/loving/caring individuals, much more so than the selfish/abusive. They'd all benefit being much more aware of the potential ill will others bear. Of course, around decent, caring, and loving people, most of these laws are completely unnecessary.

This book was given to me by my brother. He said it would change my life and it did.  It is very split up into small parts that make it either very easy or very difficult to read according to your nature. Each law has examples for and against it from historic figures. After reading this book i identified so many behaviors in myself and others. It allowed my to take better control of myself and my relationships.That being said this book requires work.  Self improvement is never easy. The way it's divided makes it a long term project. Revisiting it after digesting its insights will surely give perspective to you and the people in your life.

This is a great book. The laws really give you an insight to various power struggles, successes and techniques. I found this book both informative and instructional when it came to various situations which we all take part in in our daily lives.One thing which particular stood out for me with this book was how Robert Greene gave case studies of the past where it was used. During Chinese Dynasties or War Situations. These really helped to see how the law works and where you can apply the law to help all those around, even if it is just yourself.

Not a great book for what it’s depicted to portray. It’s a history lesson of weird things that went down back in the 1800s.  Not much to learn here.

As with Carnegie’s “How to Win friends and influence people” I have to lament not reading this treasure trobe of everyday wisdom earlier. And I have to say, this must be every politician’s handbook.I loved the hystorical examples and the power play analyses, especially when familiar stories, characters and their actions gain new meaning through the connections penned by author.I saw some have reviewed this book and called it evil. I fail to see how practical knowledge of this kind can be evil. You won’t read this and become a villain. But you will read this and and be able to spot the villain.If there’s one thing I didn’t like it’s the intertwining of laws and stories/fables/short passages in red. They were a constant distraction, contextual true, but I would have prefferd them place at the end of chapters rather than inbetween paragraphs.Looking forward to War, Mastery & Seduction.

I bought this after years of toying with it. I have had his book Seduction for a number of years and that was also not quote what I thought. Robert Greene honestly seems Like.. Frued in a way, he seems to understand psychology from an interesting perspective, but a very jaded one as well. ALL of his books aren't about learning to politic, or get along, or figure out how to win, the are more about learning to how play people, destroy your opponent and divert attention from your mistakes onto others's, there are some nuggets here and there, like law #35 when negotiating always give two options that you win either way.. never give one win and one loss option - I like that.. but then there are so many twisted ones in here.. honestly, he seems.. kind of cukoo. So I guess it depends on where you are in your evolution. To me this was kind of a waste of money.

As a victim of manipulation,  I would like to warn people this book needs trigger alerting. Also this book holds a very rigid and unipolar approach to what power is. Power can hold different meanings to different people. Here it is all about getting what YOU WANT while creating wreckage and muck that you leave others to cleanup for you. A narcissistic approach, although I did see they tried to tell people that you should not use these techniques in your own nest and with your own people.

2014-05-30 ... I discovered the ""48 Laws of Power"" (48LP) about 15 years ago when it was first published.  A little background on why I was ""blown-away"" by this book.  First, I'm a history guy (who enjoys a well-written account).  Second, I'm a professional (Senior Mechanical Engineer) working in an office environment.  Third, during the first two decades of that career I witnessed (as do we all) the typical variations of Machevellian blood-letting in the office, as the ""Bad Guys"" decimated their way to the top of the corporate ladder.  Indeed, I was at least once or twice the unwitting ""pawn"" in their plans, and my ignorance of their genuinely ""evil ways"" caused me and my family financial harm.  So I accidently discover (and purchase) 48LP, just on a whim.  I was astounded !!!  I read about 4 chapters a night, often (almost) literally falling-out of my reading chair.  For every ""law"" that Robert Greene expounded on, I recalled event after event where I had seen it happen in my own career.  Great ""office politics"" mysteries were finally understood.  I immediately purchased four (4) hard-back versions for my children (then in their teens); the books were safely put-away, and then (10 years later) given to each of my kids as they entered the professional workforce in their twenties.  They've actually appreciated the knowledge and wisdom Robert Greene writes about.  Do your children and grandchildren a big favor -- protect them (armed with exceptional knowledge) from the Machevellian ""office criminals"" that they'll encounter in their own furures.

I have read over 100 books on sales, business, and self help. This is my favorite. The amount of knowledge and value this book provides is unbelievable. Even if you do not plan on following the rules it is important that you at least understand them and can determine when other people are using them. At the end of the book you are left asking yourself ""Am I a better or worse person after reading this"". The author Robert Greene is the first to admit that if you view these laws as gospel and follow all of the laws to the full extreme you are borderline psychopathic. It is the reader's job to take these laws, learn from them, and use them in a positive way without negatively impacting your relationships with the people in your life.

This book will change your life. The way you use it is up to you. The techniques, tactics and strategies in the book are not immoral, they are amoral. The tactics are neither good nor evil, but the nature of power means they will increase your capacity for either.More importantly, it will allow you to recognize these tactics when people use or prepare to use them against you. You'll be able to see their next move, predict how they will react when you counter their check. Being a victim in the game of life will be a lot less likely for you after reading this book.Beyond that, you will understand politics in an entirely new way. You'll start to see the moves the powerful make with a sharper perspective because you'll have the inside game.

I was expecting a book about power. Disappointingly, this book is about grifting. The author seems to have a really warped view of the world, and an excessively high opinion of himself. Terms are not well defined, in most cases they’re not defined at all. The main text is frequently interrupted by loosely related anecdotes. Very disjointed. Given that the book is about deceit, why are we the readers expected to take so much at the author’s word? If you bought this book, congratulations, you just got grifted out of about $15.

I got myself through this book while commuting. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. The only thing that got me through it were all of the historical 1400's 1500's stories. I may have enjoyed a 2 hour book about manipulating people alongside a companion 4 hour book on cool historical people like Napoleon and that circus guy he wouldn't stop talking about. Putting it all together over the course of 24 hours was too much for me. Those are 24 hours that I could have been learning spanish or talking to my grandma. I understand why this book exists and why some people would want this sitting on their shelves, but it goes way overboard on normal social situations. I work in a government, military branch, so bits and pieces were relevant to previous careers or social situations, but not many. I guess if you're a NY banker trying to make partner you might want to look through a paper version of this book. Interpretation: Read something else.

Aaron G.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
Many of the reviews on here (okay, several, I only skimmed those on the front page) are critiquing the book solely as a self-help or business strategy book. That's fine; that's what the book is usually billed as.Yes, the laws provide important lessons on life. The reader may integrate them into their worldview as they and their moral sense sees fit.However, the laws themselves are just a small part of why I find this book so enjoyable, and why I feel compelled to take it off the bookshelf every so often. If you only want a run-down of Greene's laws, you don't have to look far for those (hint: if you don't mind squinting, it's called the ""Look Inside"" feature). But you'll be missing so much.Greene accompanies each of his laws with examples taken from history, myth and literature, demonstrating the advice followed as well as ignored, and the supposed ramifications of each path. Along the way, little anecdotes and excerpts along the same theme are included in the margins (this may be Joost Elffers' contribution).Whether or not you agree with Greene's conclusions (he is an English major and a writer, after all, not a world leader), reading how he interprets these stories and ties them to the main advice is highly enjoyable. You will be exposed to a lot of literary and historical references that you may not have been until now, and may pick up a number of ideas for further study.If you just want a list of platitudes and are not interested in the rest of the writing, then I would suggest you go right to the source with 
The Art of Worldly Wisdom
. You will find that almost all of Greene's laws come from Gracian's 300 aphorisms in one way or another. Unlike Gracian's concise little manual, however, Greene offers a brief literary and historical study with each case that's certainly worth the price of admission. In fact, I recommend you buy both of the books.

I remember a friend at work recommended reading this book. He was going to let me borrow it(I bought the Art of Seduction and planned on reading it before reading this) and I would let him borrow the Art of Seduction; a book exchange. Unfortunately, my friend was fired so I didn't get the chance to borrow the 48 Laws.I had remembered  this, and went ahead and bought it. I thought it was better to read this first before the Art of Seduction. Before reading the 48 Laws, I began the Art of Seduction, but couldn't get into it.As soon as I began 48 Laws, I was intrigued. This was kind of book I was looking for. Because of my interest in the 48 Laws, I began the Art of Seduction again; reading these two books, side by side(not literally), I saw connections, and wanted to finish them; because of my curiosity, I wanted to see if these principles can be applied.I like the author's style of writing, explaining historical events, describing classical literary works; he would then explain observances and transgressions of these Laws, and how they can be interpreted.I really liked this book, and will come back to it again for another read.

POWER... It's ruthless, it's cunning, it's loyal, it's backstabbing.  Just like life really is without the sugar or even Equal.  This extension of Niccolo Machiavelli's ""The Prince"" is so interesting to read.  I couldn't put the book down and finished it on the plane to Italy and back.  If you can take some harsh realities and realize that people are just like you and are mainly interested in their own survival and not necessarily yours... you'll be able to accept what this book has to offer.  If you're timid... read the Prince first.  Then graduate to POWER.

I usually read non-fiction biographies, and out of sheer boredom,(I’m glad) I purchased this book. It’s throughly entertaining if you read it through the lens of a spectator or someone who is absolutely willing to avoid some of the historical examples outlined in this book. A lot of readers here are appalled, but personally it enabled me to take a step back and look at my personal relations and the parts they’ve played in my life. I was able to confront certain patterns of peoples behavior as well as my own. Hopefully this book falls into the right hands, and I hope the viewers sees this from a neutral standpoint.As for the “laws”, I’m not one bit surprised. A lot of it were taken from historical accounts of ancient adages, conquerors and religious texts. If anyone is afraid, it should be the people who are willing and able to exploit (manipulate) others.This should be used a cautionary handbook or as an tool of awareness.

I read an average of 3 to 4 books per month...every month...and of the thousands that I have read..this condensed blend of psychology, history, and order is a significant solution for depression! In the words of Yoda ""Named must your fear be...before banish it you can!"" This book helps you to define the game of power;to know when and how you will be,or are currently being manipulated, in the struggle for power. Many say that depression is a lack of empowerment...you might find it here. Some of the chapters are distubing...unsettling even, as the meaning remains like a pebble in your shoe, to motivate reflection and change. Well done.

I bought this book because I am the only female working in an environment of men -- most commonly thirty-five to sixty men and most of them under the age of forty.  The environment can be empathic or hostile and can change its face at any given moment. Having deciphered those moments of change as moments of power grabs or diversions, I decided that I needed to understand how and why power is obtained.The 48 Laws of Power did help me understand how power can be obtained and did give me some defensive mechanisms to thwart unnecessary anxiety when struggles occur.  The divisive thought that arose for me while reading the book was the manipulative role of women in power. Can we really lose power by not showing enough love?  Can we be as aggressive as men in seeking power without making us more vulnerable?  Must we do without friends in such an environment?I agreed with the concepts of concealment, saying less than necessary, guarding reputations,not offending the wrong person, assuming formlessness, etc. However, in my work environment it is impossible to avoid the unlucky, use bait to get people to come to me, use generosity to disarm my victims, use absence to increase respect and honor,not build fortresses to protect myself, not offend the wrong person, play the perfect courtier,keep my hands clean, create a cultlike following, plan all the way to the end, or create compelling spectacles.I don't believe I could use many of the laws in daily practice, but the book did help me understand those who do and did increase my understanding of power brokers in a difficult environment.

You have lots of ideas about what POWER IS. Most of your ideas are probably wrong. It's not your fault. The news shows clearly 99% of people AREN'T powerful. Why? One big reason: a lack of readily available knowledge on the subject. Type POWER into Amazon search and you'll find a only handful of books on the subject, most of them mediocre. Same goes for the Internet. Don't you find that odd?People are only as good at something as they have learned and applied in their life. This holds true for everything, including power.The 48 Laws Of Power is one of the best books on the topic: Well thought out, well written, and well packaged. The formula is the same for Robert Greene's other books, as well.It's a big book with lots to digest and worth it. Best read one chapter per sitting. Then take some time away to reflect. That kind of a good book.I've read A LOT of books on the subject of Power. To save you time and money, here's a variety of other goods books on power: Power vs Force by David Hawkins, The Prince by Machiavelli, Art Of War by Sun Tze, On War by Carl von Clausewitz, Knowledge/Power by Foucault, Art Of Power by Thich Nhat Hanh, Anatomy Of Power by John Kenneth Galbraith, Secrets Of Power vol 1 & 2 by Ingo Swann, and Power by Jeffrey Pfeffer. These titles run the gamut from Spirituality to War to Government and Office Politics to Philosophy and more.What's missing from all these books? This: Power is different at every level of human development. What's needed is the additional  understanding that transformation plays in power. I coach clients daily in mastering their own power. When they learn about power they use what they have better and more wisely. They acquire more power while staying a ""good guy"". Most everyone both craves and fears power. As a result, they lack true power. They crave power because deep inside they feel powerless and a need to control others OR they fear power from a concern of abusing it. All this is learned in childhood and needs to be re-learned in an intelligent and healthy way in adulthood because power is at the core of everyone of us. It drives everything we do and we all need more of YOU.48 Laws Of Power is a solid read to help you understand both the strengths and possible consequences of many different kinds of power and power plays. Combine it with the previous titles and you'll possess a quality section in your library on Power. Hope this helps. Enjoy!

This is a great book if you want to have the Armor of Knowledge equipped in your head. Certain laws contradict each other but the whole point is to use them when the need arises. There's 48 laws while during my lifetime, I will have countless encounters with people I prefer to avoid. Not just the workplace but school and real life I see not just stupid people but deceiving, narcissistic, and self-absorbed who want to shove your views down your throat. You can get respond back and crush their spirit (Law 15) or leave them alone for the insects that they are (Law 36). This book may be looked as manipulative but the people who have used these laws have their names carved onto History. And as a result, the Author has broken down their actions of the past and turned them into a guide on how to help and instruct the reader on how to master himself or herself and take on the world.  But then again this is how certain trash and scumbags are born. Genghis Khan, Count Victor Lustig, Yellow Kid Weil, King Henry (don't know which one), Mao Zedong (He lowkey uses this Man a lot). I'm giving this 4 stars outta 5 because there's some laws I wouldn't use. Maybe because I'm a nice guy but I prefer not to have ghosts from the past haunting my behind. The IRS can do that.

The 48 Laws of Power breaks down HOW the Power Game works in Society by 48 principles then it goes into real historical examples of people who used those principles to success and power and examples of people who disregarded those principles and the failure that followed. It is an amoral NOT immoral look at Power Games throughout history and as Machiavelli's ""Prince"" a look into that world. It's action packed and hard to put down. It's practical and gut level. It's where reading that book that You look into Your own life and begin to compare and see Your own successes and failures comparing them to those principle that it hits hard. If nothing else it give a look into the shadowy world of the Global Elites and HOW they ALL operate in their own games in High Society and being aware gives You a safeguard in life to know the users and power game freaks out there.

They call it amoral, or outright manipulative.  News Flash for you, we are all manipulators, every decisions and choice we make in interpersonal relationships, is an act of manipulation.  The problem is that people rarely want to accept this dark truth and instead want to hold up the vale of selflessness believing that a life of sacrificing one's own happiness for the happiness of others is a true path to success in life.I am a liberal.  I voted Obama twice, I vote Democrat 90% of the time.  But, to say that politicians don't use these techniques to great effect to gain power would be ridiculous.  To say that Obama didn't use these effects... you must be kidding me.  His entire story in politics is one of Machiavellian rise.  Then, the negative reviewers mock politics, and say, ""Well if you want to be a politician, than go for it.""  This book doesn't promote stealing or defrauding people.  This book is about using and manipulating circumstances and events to have people elevate you to places of power by raising your status and importance.  This is not what Enron did that made it a bad company.  This is not what Dick Cheney did that made him a bad man.  This is not what Jack Abramaof did that got him put in jail.  It was the crimes, the theft, the defrauding, and the occasional murder. It is what got Dick Cheney put in power and what has happened to him.  Is he awaiting trial?  No he isn't.  Is he being put to death?  No, no... he's not.  Is he living high off of our money, able to travel the world with all the protection any man could ask for... yes, yes that does seem to be what he's doing.  Interesting... very interesting. Nowhere does this book recommend criminal behavior.  Nowhere does this book promote crime.  It promotes deception, it promotes using the true nature of human psychology that almost every leader has ever used.Whitewashed text books that talk about win-win scenarios are idealistic at best, plain wrong at most.  I'm someone who has read every one of them.  Social Psychology text books, Persuasion and Influence Textbooks, and have read the studies and methods.  Here's what we now know, an expensive piece of jewelry looked at from about a distance of ten or more feet away, while standing on a soft carpet is more desirable, than when standing three or five feet away on a soft carpet, however, even more desirable, when standing on a hard floor three to five feet away, but less desirable on a hard floor ten or more feet away.  This is why you'll see several stores using carpet in one area, and floor in the jewelry area.  It's not manipulation, it's using human psychology to your advantage.This is simply a book distilling what has worked throughout history.  Call me bitter.  I've had businesses undermined by people who have used these strategies, I've had girlfriends stolen by people who swept in with neurosis and need and creating false wants, it's only when I decided that everyone else is living a life the way they want it, and on their own terms, and I'm playing by mystical rules that few others are following that my life began to change.  When I threw away the morals and ethics and decided instead to embrace my life as my own and to live it with my full ability.Not only is this book a handy guide to getting and staying in power, it's a handy guide to watching people who are trying to take that power from you.

What we're reading in this book is exactly what we're seeing before our very eyes regarding politicians, the music and entertainment business,  religion, families (especially when there is  Will involved), corporate, the #MetooMovement, reality TV, and at our very own places where we work.I have no intention of following these types of behaviors which are advocated in this book.  According to the author, this probably means, i'll die, homeless, without friends, no makeup, broke,  bald, and disenchanted - Just like Nicola Tesla!When someone tells you to use ""Honesty as a tool for deception"" - then why even bother to use the word ""Honesty""?  Just say, ""Be a compulsive lying, manipulative, cold-blooded narcissist like our very own #45 (Trump and his administration), and you'll be wealthy.""Granted, the only people whom you'll call ""friends"" will basically be parasites, saboteurs, or con-artists, just like yourself!  This makes for  entertaining, intimate evenings with people you SHOULD enjoy being around.  You won't be happy, you have no one you can trust, no one can trust you, and any one who comes near you will probably have a concealed container of pepper spray, or weapon handy - just in case.This is a world, i can't stomach on most days, folks.  But it's real and surrounds us every single moment of our lives.  Millions of people are fighting for the chance being a ""courtier"".  Many of them just for the chance to eat the crumbs from their tables and brag about it.  People want to be seen, heard, revered, feared, and still come off as a ""class act"", or even worse? They demand respect, even when they have none for themselves.  But acording to the author? In order to ""look"" as if you have class, you have to act like something someone dragged from the depths of a compost pile to make it all happen.The author, has a point, and certainly does not hold back on the examples.  He did a great job with his research, and bringing his points home to the reader.  I'm just grateful, that i grew to have instincts later in life to just stay away from these types of people.The last thing i want to do when i go out to dinner with someone whom i call a friend, is have to deal with an individual who's been ""scripted"" by the writer of the Hunger Games.  I would like to HAVE dinner, not BE the dinner.I, for one, like to sleep at night.  But if i had to lay with the author or people of that type of mentality, i'd have to sleep with both eyes open..Great book, if you want to learn the ""mentality"" of the power hungry, status seeking, ambitious, manipulative, parasitic types.  If you don't want to read the book?  Keep watching the news.  Especially the politicians.  It's just as informative, as well as entertaining.  But even worse, today's news is  going to be someone's example for the next ""Power"" book.

I chose to buy this book off Amazon due to the fact that it was no longer sold at my current school's bookstore. For anyone who wants to up their social standing, is studying psychology and/or sociology, or anyone who wants to harness their inner power more, THIS IS THE BOOK. I enjoy how it gives historical references that are relevant even to the times we are in in addition to giving explanations on the side such as info behind historical figures and the like. While some of the laws may seem too harsh (such as crushing your enemies totally) or frankly impossible, for some people, I still recommend reading about it to have a better understanding of it. All in all, an excellent read.

I picked this book up for $1, proof that there is no correlation between cost and value.This would be the book that Machievelli would have written, had he courted the Aristocracy of his times, rather than attempting to ingratiate the Prince.The author gives a hint to his motivations for this composition when he states in his acknowledgments:""Finally, to those people in my life who have so skillfully used the game of power to manipulate, torture and cause me pain over the years, I bear you no grudges and I thank you for supplying me with the inspiration for the 48 Laws of Power.""This book is cathartic. But before diving deeper, a reader should be prepared to entertain the following ideas:1. A Human being is no more than a sophisticated animal with self-interest as the primary motivator2. Everyone wants more power, not less3. Be true to yourself first and foremost, don't be a sucker4. Power is a game and the better you play, the better your life will be5. Power is essentially amoral and one of the most important skills to acquire is the ability to see circumstances rather than good or evil6. To triumph, it is necessary alternate between being both cunning and formless7. Beyond linear dualities of good and evil, there is a third dimension, the strategists' mind8. The indirect path, that of influence is more effective and the use of it is an artIf you can live with the above, the 48 laws of power serves as a handbook on the arts of indirection.This book argues that by mastering ones emotions, understanding the people involved and the fundamental dynamics of interrelationships within society determine the extent of ones accomplishments. Power is ultimately an artificial construct, given legitimacy by the people who participate in the game.We need power to survive in a competitive world that is constantly seeking to recruit us into the ambitions of others. We can drain our lives in the fulfillment of others, or best use our given life, energy and talents at our own discretion. Implicit to this design is the belief that society defaults a role to you, whether or not that role reflects your beliefs and understanding about yourself. A choice then has to be made on your part to accept such a role or to resist whether in an active or passive way. In the latter sense, one will turn upon themselves. It is better then to assert some degree of control by exercising influence and demonstrating an identity that is consistent with the person whom we feel ourselves to be, in other words, to actualize ones' self. Although this end state transcends any particular identification, characterization or ego, the path to it requires a struggle and this book is about the methods and devices used by successful participants. The good news is, the struggle can be worthwhile, rewarding and the unexpected consequences enlightening.The perfect archetypical master of the laws of power is the Courtier, who possesses more than anything, a talent to influence. Cognizant of how he is perceived at all times in a socially competitive world, the Courtier is ever vigilant to monitor his own effect, ever mindful of the elusiveness of power. I believe that this is what the author means by the Courtiers mirror.The core realization is that more than anything, human beings are the most social of animals, so it goes without saying that the most socially adapted animal attains the best that life has to offer. Human beings also possess Consciousness to such a heightened degree, that they can deliberately break and follow a path in defiance to their instincts and conditioned or learned behaviors, unlike animals.In a paradoxical way, learning to play the game of power teaches virtues of mindfulness, patience and mastering ones ego. In this sense, the book permits another legitimate path to the completion of ones life without blindly accepting a given religion.Well written, argued and referenced, it is abundantly clear how the author reaches his conclusions. It is highly accessible and well digested for the reader. There is a great deal of truth to the idea that a book serves as a mirror for the reader and I am hard pressed to argue against the wisdom contained in this manual. There is great peace of mind to be had from accepting fundamental truths.Some would read this book and walk away with the impression that this is a ""how to"" on manipulation. Beware of such people, as their delusions make them a danger to themselves and anyone who places trust in them. You need not become a con artist to derive benefit from what is contained here. The laws of cause and effect and the aphorism of ""Know thyself"" are embedded as living proof, ignore them to your peril.

This book is really well written. The examples and stories in it are excellent and entertaining in themselves. Your life is probably not as grand as the situations that are explained in the book, and of past lives in history. Its hard to change the way you live and come into situations where you can use this knowledge. I understand, and have a WAY different view of how the world works now, that I can use from time to time as a guide.**2013 updated** If you use this book as a life guide you will be missing the finer points that matter most. Trust, friendship, and love are more important than anything in this book. You could very well master everything in here be dysfunctional inside. You can't always have the upper hand and amaze people. Control does not fulfill or make life worth living. I'm not religious but the bible contains better wisdom than this book. Its still worth reading though.

The author brilliantly uses a diverse collection of historical stories to illustrate each of the laws. Not only does he demonstrate the law being utilized successfully, he also gives (often humorous and ironic) stories detailing unfortunate results due to the law NOT being observed. I'm not a history buff, but I really enjoyed the stories.Also, in the margins of the book, the author lists relevant quotes from famous people, as well as fables, folktales, and other tidbits of information that demonstrate that chapter's law.Overall it's a smart, entertaining and clever read.

This book is a must-read for anyone who wants to live an independent life. You will encounter the challenges Greene writes about, and this book offers useful strategies for overcoming them.I know Greene's thinking is sound because I've tested it. With no business or technical education, I managed to increase my income 400% in just a few years. With my own money and leverage, I bought a house in the most expensive city [housing-wise] in America.Maybe your ambitions are different. Whatever you want, you won't get it without planning. All along the way, you must deal with people. You must get around or through them. This book is a great help. It is a masterpiece. I can't recommend it too strongly.

I have just spent all summer reading and digesting this book and am  eagerly awaiting Greene's October release of ""The Art of  Seduction.""Nietzsche once wrote, ""Anything truly productive  is offensive.""

Pay no attention to the  reviewers who say the laws contradict each other.  They don't.  They rather  compliment each other in the game of life.

J. Patterson,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
Just what is power? I believe that through the amoral approach demonstrated in the 48 Laws of Power, Greene has gotten much closer to this answer and at the same time, gotten around many of the issues that plague discussions of power. This does not mean that ethics is not important when handling power, but rather, that power is morally neutral and is a tool that one can utilize within their own ethical systems. Everybody from the subjectivist to the altruistic individual can make use of power as it is defined in this text.While some may become disgusted at the ammorality and the examples that often show a ""low brow"" use of power, this does not take away from the value of this book, and in fact probably adds to it by showing how power can be used to harm others; someone could probably even apply Law 7 (which in part refers to using the wisdom of others) in order to create examples that show positive uses of power.Overall, I would recommend this book for anybody, but especially those studying Leadership and/or Politics.

This book is Phenomenal. You might not become a powerful figure by reading this, but it will definitely give you a better handle on how politics, and people really work and think. Each law has an example taken from history, sometimes when the law was followed, when it was transgressed, and sometimes both. These stories are often hilarious, clever, and sometimes you really just have to put the book down and reflect of how amazing some events in history truly were. Each chapter is short, great to read in one go, also a great bathroom reader as well. Would definitely recommend to anyone who's interested in what really drives people as to better understand how to better accomplish one's own goals.

The information in The 48 Laws of Power is excellent and could be used for the purposes of good or bad, depending on how the reader applies it. Also, there were a lot of interesting history lessons, various power plays from the past that we can learn from, that helped put the laws into context.  I liked reading about situations in which people broke a law (and the result). My only complaint is that the electronic version had some annoying misspellings and missing images.

Love it.  This book is the PERFECT gift for the new college grad entering the work force.  I wish I read this 11 years ago when I graduated, it would have saved me a LOT of frustration.  I'm realizing all the mistakes I've made and surprisingly they would have been easy to avoid had I just had a little bit of knowledge before entering my career.I didn't feel that the laws were a serious threat to my morals.  Some of them, if taken to the extreme, certainly would be.  For the most part though, the majority of the laws can be used sparingly without feeling like you are selling your soul to the devil.I suggest taking personal notes after reading each law.  Reflect on the law and write down some ideas of how you can apply it to your life, decide if you are willing to use the law or if it violates your own personal morals, think of ways to defend against others who may use the law on you, think of ways that using the law might backfire on you, etc.  I did this and it was a huge help.  By the time I was done with the book I had a nice personal summary and ""power plan"" written out for myself.I noticed some reviewers who thought the laws sometimes contradicted themselves.  I agree to a point.  Sometimes they did.  I suppose the word ""laws"" makes it seem like they are set in stone and should always be true.  I tended to think of these laws more of tactics.  Some tactics work in certain situations and in other situations a contradicting tactic may be more suitable.I also found it extremely eye opening to the violence of life in the past.  If anything it made me more grateful for living in a modern and more civilized society.  Sure, the deception, back stabbing, and lies are still here today but at least you don't have to worry about getting your head chopped off.  At least when you get stabbed in the back today, it's metaphorically.  I mean, every story ended with at least one person getting their head chopped off or drowned or impaled with a spike.  Unbelievable.  I'm not just talking about lowly peasants either.  The kings / emperors / generals / courtiers / all seemed to be gambling with their life on a daily basis.  P*ss off the wrong person and your head went in a basket.

This is not the book, it’s just a notebook with the same cover.  Somewhat deceptive as the reviews are for the actual book.

It has been several months since I became a disciple of Mr. Greene.  I don't read this book, I study it.I have stood up to abusive relatives by retreating when I had to, waiting for them come to me, saying less than is necessary and ultimately winning through my actions not argument.The chapter on dealing with your boss is invaluable.  I am careful now to never seem like a smart-ass in front of my supervisors. They are the sun and I orbit them- no problem.I have used the chapters on playing to people's fantasies and building a cult in five easy steps to create an amazing program in my classroom that my students cannot resist- it helps them learn and the parents love it.I have just gotten started.  I love this book so much and am so grateful to have found it.If you are foolish enough to think power is a worthless commodity then answer me this:  Why do the wealthiest men in the world, men who have everything money can buy, run for political office?  They do it because power is an irresistible delicacy.I've had a taste and I'm coming back for more!
