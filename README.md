# SentimentAnalysisProject

Got the data from Amazon Reviews on the "48 Laws of Power" Book, through a web scraping process and then parsing the HTML files.

* bookreview_.csv file is the raw data that's been collected from the HTML code
* SentimentAnalysis.csv is the clean file with the Sentiment scores.
